        We do not publish staff profiles on this website, and we never
        will. Our teachers' privacy is not negotiable — not for marketing,
        not for anything else. What we owe you instead is something more
        useful than a photograph: an honest account of how we build and
        hold our faculty to a standard.

        A child's education is only as strong as the person standing in
        front of them every day. So rather than show you faces, we'd
        rather show you the thinking behind who gets to stand there.

          If you have questions about who is teaching your child, ask us
          directly — we will always answer honestly, in person or over a
          call. That conversation belongs to you and us. It doesn't
          belong on a public webpage.
