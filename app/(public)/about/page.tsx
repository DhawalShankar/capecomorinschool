        Our Story
      </h1>
      <p className="text-[#3A3E45] leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Cape Comorin School was founded in 2001 with a simple belief: that
        every child deserves an education built on real effort, not
        shortcuts. For over 25 years, that belief has guided everything we
        do — from how we teach, to how we treat every single student who
        walks through our doors.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#3A3E45] leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We are a Playgroup to Class 8, English-medium, government-recognized
        school based in Ratan Lal Nagar, Kanpur. We don't chase rankings or
        trophy walls — we focus on the quieter, harder work of actually
        teaching well.

              "In 25 years, I have learned that no two children grow the same
              way, on the same day, at the same pace — and a school that
              forgets this stops being a school and becomes a factory. Our
              promise here has never been to produce the loudest results. It
              has been to notice each child closely enough to know what they
              actually need, and to give it to them without hurry."
