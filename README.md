## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase Auth (admin panel login)
- Vercel (hosting)

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd capecomorin-frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in values, see below
npm run dev
```

Public site → `http://localhost:3000`
Admin panel (local) → `http://admin.localhost:3000` (or the dev override in `middleware.ts` if set)

---

## Routing

`middleware.ts` checks the request host and rewrites to the matching route group:

- `capecomorinschool.com` → `(public)`
- `admin.capecomorinschool.com` → `(admin)`

Admin routes are additionally gated by a Firebase session check at the layout level — subdomain alone is not the access boundary.

---

## Admin Panel

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Teachers | CRUD for the public Faculty page |
| Notices | Upload (PDF/DOCX → auto-converted to PDF), publish/unpublish, delete |
| Calendar | Add/edit/delete; national holidays auto-seeded, rest manual |
| Students | Search/view/edit/TC generation (proxied to Vritukul via backend) |
| Registers | Upload scanned registers for AI extraction (proxied to Vritukul) |
| Fees | Demo log of test Razorpay transactions (not real accounting in v1) |

All requests go through `lib/api.ts` → `capecomorin-backend`, authenticated with a Firebase token. This app never calls Vritukul, Cloudinary, Razorpay, or CloudConvert directly.

---

## Related Repos

- `capecomorin-backend` — Flask API (owns all business logic, proxies to Vritukul)

---

## Deployment

Hosted on Vercel. `capecomorinschool.com` and `admin.capecomorinschool.com` point to the same deployment; `middleware.ts` splits traffic. Production env vars are set in Vercel project settings, not in the repo.
